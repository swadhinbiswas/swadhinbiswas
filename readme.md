**Python Developer | AI/ML Engineer | Problem Solver**

I build things that work. No fluff, just functional code that solves real problems.

---

## The Reality Check

Most developers have fancy titles and buzzwords. Here's what I actually do:

I write Python code every day. I build backend systems, desktop applications, and web tools. I work with data - cleaning it, analyzing it, and extracting insights from it. I implement machine learning models that actually work in production, not just in Jupyter notebooks.

I'm also learning Rust because Python isn't always the answer (shocking, I know). TypeScript and Go are in my toolkit because sometimes you need the right tool for the job, not just your favorite one.

---

## What I Actually Know

**Core Skills:**
- Python (Backend, Desktop Apps, Data Processing)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (Web Development)
- Data Analysis & Visualization
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Neural Networks (both theory and implementation)
- AI Agents & MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**Languages & Tools:**
- Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
- Rust (learning, because memory safety matters)
- Mojo (learning, because Python needs to be faster)
- Go (learning, because concurrency is important)
- **Roast-Lang** (my own creation - because sometimes you need to build your own tools)

**What I'm Good At:**
- Turning messy data into actionable insights
- Building scalable backend systems
- Creating practical ML solutions (not just POCs)
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Debugging things that shouldn't be broken but are

---

## Current Work & Focus

Right now, I'm deep into:
- Advanced data science projects with real-world applications
- Deep learning architectures that aren't just ResNet clones
- Building AI agents that can actually complete tasks
- Contributing to open source when I'm not drowning in my own projects

I'm not "exploring" or "dabbling" - I'm actively building and shipping.

## The Honest Stats

<!--START_SECTION:waka-->
```txt
TypeScript   3 hrs 8 mins    ████████▒░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   33.16 %
Markdown     2 hrs 15 mins   ██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   23.86 %

```
<!--END_SECTION:waka-->

These are my actual coding hours, not inflated numbers. I write documentation (hence the Markdown), I'm learning systems languages (Rust and Go), and I build web interfaces (TypeScript).

## What I'm Looking For

I'm interested in:
- Projects that actually matter
- Teams that ship code, not just have meetings
- Problems that require thinking, not just googling
- Opportunities to work with data and AI at scale
- Collaborations where I can learn and contribute equally

Not interested in:
- Another CRUD app tutorial
- "Ideas" without implementation
- Projects that died in 2019
- Code that exists just to pad a portfolio

---

## My Philosophy

Every problem has a solution, but not every solution needs machine learning. Sometimes you just need a good algorithm and clean data. I believe in writing code that others can read, tests that actually test things, and documentation that doesn't lie.

I'm always learning because this field moves fast. What worked yesterday might be deprecated tomorrow, and I'm okay with that.

## Let's Talk

If you want to discuss:
- Technical challenges in Python, ML, or data science
- Collaboration on meaningful projects
- Job opportunities (remote-friendly preferred)
- Why your model isn't working (we've all been there)
